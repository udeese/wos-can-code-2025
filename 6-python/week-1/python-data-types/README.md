# Python Data Types

In Python, we can categorize data types into two main groups: **primitive** (or simple) data types and **composite** (or complex) data types.

## Primitive (Simple) Data Types:

- Strings (`str`): Represents sequences of characters enclosed in quotes, e.g., "hello", 'world'.
- Integers (`int`): Represents whole numbers, e.g., 1, -5, 100.
- Floating-Point Numbers (`float`): Represents decimal numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0.
- Booleans (`bool`): Represents the values `True` or `False`.
- None (`NoneType`): Represents the absence of a value or null.

## Composite (Complex) Data Types:

- Lists (`list`): Represents a collection of elements, e.g., [1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'].
- Tuples (`tuple`): Represents a collection of elements (similar to lists), but tuples are immutable, e.g., (1, 2, 3), ('a', 'b', 'c').
- Dictionaries (`dict`): Represents a collection of key-value pairs, e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}.
- Sets (`set`): Represents a collection of unique elements, e.g., {1, 2, 3}, {'a', 'b', 'c'}.

It's important to note that Python treats all data types, both primitive and composite, as _objects_. Each data type has its own set of methods and attributes associated with it, making them more than just simple representations of values.

### Naming Variables

- Conventions
  - Variable names are written in `snake_case`
  - Class names are written in `PascalCase`
- Rules
  - Cannot start with a number
  - Cannot contain hyphens
  - Cannot use reserved keywords
