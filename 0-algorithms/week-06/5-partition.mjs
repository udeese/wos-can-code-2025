/* 
  Params: numbers, left, right
    - left and right are indexes that define the portion of the array to partition.
    - Initially, left will be 0 and right will be the last index.
    - Later, these parameters can specify a subsection of the array for partitioning.

  Steps:

  1. Choose a pivot value from the array (commonly the middle element, but any element can be chosen).

  2. Rearrange the array in place so that all values less than the pivot are on its left,
     and all values greater than the pivot are on its right (the order within these sections is not sorted).

  3. Return the index where the left section of smaller items ends.

  Choosing a random pivot helps avoid worst-case O(n^2) performance that can happen if the first or last element is always chosen,
  especially for nearly sorted or reverse sorted data.
  Choosing the middle element is also a good choice in most cases.

const numbers1 = [11, 8, 14, 3, 6, 2, 7];
/* 
There are many possible correct outputs for numbers1 depending on the pivot chosen.

For example, if 3 is chosen as the pivot, some valid partitions include:
[2, 3, 7, 6, 11, 8, 14]
[2, 3, 11, 8, 7, 6, 14]
[2, 3, 8, 7, 11, 6, 14]
[2, 3, 8, 6, 14, 7, 11]

const numbers3 = [1, 17, 12, 3, 9, 13, 21, 4, 27];
const numbers4 = [2, 1];
