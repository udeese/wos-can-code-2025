=== === CONDITIONALS EXERCISE === ===
Write a Python program that takes an integer input
from the user and checks whether it is positive,
negative, or zero. Use conditional statements
(`if`, `elif`, `else`) to implement this logic.

Example Output:

Enter a number: 5
5 is a positive number.

Enter a number: -3
-3 is a negative number.

Enter a number: 0
0 is neither positive nor negative.
